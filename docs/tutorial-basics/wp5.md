# WP5: Hybrid Learning Paradigm for Secure and PrivacyPreserving AI
WP5 will propose a three-tier privacy-preserving hybrid learning paradigm for prioritised predictions. It will integrate state-of-the-art privacy enhancing technologies into the proposed hybrid learning paradigm.The WP will develop security mechanisms to defend against attacks towards the cyber-physical system and AI models and datasets.Lastly, the WP will establish a quantitative metric to measure global privacy loss.
